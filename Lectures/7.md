- UART, seriall
    - Full duplex protocol (both ways), one bit at a time.
        - bit by bit but it is usually stored in 'shift' register so after it is read with actuall processor
    - UART is actually chip that makes serial communication possible
    - TTY a type of device that uses communication, such as a keyboard or printer
    - RS-232 is the standart that defines the electrical charactersitcs of the serial communication signal.
- 1-Wire
    - The "wire" carries borh power and communication hence 1-wire.
    - You still need a ground wire, so this is really a 2-wire system.
    - You talk to 1-wire devices directly through an interface chip, either with usb.
    - DS2480B:  aserial to 1-wire interface
    - TXD and RXD are serial data (POL sets polarity)
    - GND, VDD, VPP are inlines
    - 1-wire goes to power boss
    - On a 1-wire bus, you can add: A/D and D/A converters, thermomenters, timer, ..
    - Each device has a unique adress. The main processor can query the bus to find all the devices. on it. Then can queryy....
    - Simplest hardware, cheap, small devices. Two or 3-write bus possnile
    - Slow: hard to chieve mroe than 30kb/s 100kb/s(theroerical). Only useful for slow sensors: temp, light, etc.
    - Missing interfaces.
- I2C
    - The name stands for "Inter - Integrated Circuit Bus"
    - A small area network connecting ICs and other electronic systems
    Originally intended for operation on one sigle board / PCB
        - Synchronous Serial Signal
        - Two wires carry information between a number of devices
        - One wire use for the data
        - One wire used for the clokc
    - Today, variety of devices are available with I2C interfaces
        -    Microcontrollers, EEPROM, Real-time, interfaces and many others
    - Half-duplex
    - Data transfer between ICs and stems a realivery low rates
        - Classic is rated to 100k bits/second
        - Fast mode devides support up to 400k bits/second
        - High speed..
    - 4 wires, GROUND, VOLTAGE, DATA, CLOCK
    - 7 bit adresses (maybe 10)
    - Multi master capabilities, clokc synchronication, arbitraion procedure
    - Transmisson speed to 100Khz
    - Max. line capacitance of 400pF, approximately 4 meters (12 feet)
    - Allows series resistor for IC protection
    - Compatible with different IC technologies
    - Master
        - Initiates a transfer by generatin start and stop conditions
        - Generates he clock
        - Transmits the slave adress
        - Determines data transfer direction
    - Slave
        - Responds only when adressed
        - Timing is controlled by the clock
    - Adresses startin with 0000 or 1111 have special functions
        - 0000000 is a General call Adress
        - 0000001 is anull (CBUS) adress
        - 1111XXX Adress Extension
        - 1111111 Adress extension - next bytes are actual adress
    - Master can be
        - Transmitter only
        - Transmitter and receiver
    - Slaves an be 
        - Receiver only
        - Receiver and transmitter
- sPI
    - Bus wires
        - Master-OUT, SLave-In
        - Master-In, Slave-Out
        - Sytem clokc
        - Slave select/chip select
    - Master asserts slave/chip select lines
    - Master generates clock isgnal
    - Shifts registers shift data in and out
    - No adresses
    - MOSI - carries data out of master to slavbe
    - MISO carries data ouf of lave to master
    - Have command
        - Measure mode
        - Reead nad write temeprature data reigter
        - Activate self test for X-channel
        - Activate selft test for Y-channel
        - Read x channel celeratention though SPI
        - Read y channel celeratention though SPI
    - Fast for point-to-point connectoions
    - Easilly allows treaming / constant dataa inflow
    - No adressing in protocl, so its simple to implement 
    - Broadly supported
    - Many wires if multiple salves
    - Clock speed is difficult to manage
    - Used everywhere
- USB
    - Diffrent versions
    - 4 wires, VCC, DATA +, DATA -, GROUND
    - Two waves used for noise reduction.
- Ethernet
    - Like usb, really a point to point topology, so hubs needded to build networks
    - Ethernet driver chips relatively complex and expensive and the protocol (TCP/IP) is complex
    - Still the best way to put a device on network
- IRDA (Infrared)
    - 2 MB/s common
    - Infrared protocl based on serial communication. Many serial modules support irda
    - very limited range, high power required     
- Bluetooth
    - Very popular wireless standart
    - Different version and speeds
    - Low energy version
    - Some support for analog data, including speech.
    - Serial - virtual serial port
- CANBUS
    - Automotive
    - Low Energy
    - Serial
    - Used in carss
