# Motors

- Servo motor
- Gear motor
    - Have gears
- Stepper motor
    - Works by steps, can hold it position
- Brushless motor
- Brushed motor (DC motor)
- AC motoros
- Selenoids
- Encoders
- Controllers
- BLDC

### Simple DC motor circuit.
- Connect the motor to DC power supply
- Charge build-up can cause damage
- Reverse current surge through the voltage supply
- Arc across the switch and discharge
- Adding a diode in parallel with the motor provides a path for dissipation of stored energy when the switch is opened.
- Pulse-width modulation (PWM) for DC motor speed control
- The voltage supplied to a DC motor controls its speed
- Arduino canot supply variable DC output
    - Arduino lacks a true analog output
    - Use Pulse-width modulation (PWM) to simulate a variable DC supply voltage
    - PWM is a common technique for supplying variable power level to "slow" electrical devices such as resistive loads, LEDs and DC motors
    - On arduino these pints are marked with ~.
    - Veff = Vs * To/Tc
    - Arduino duty cycle is an 8 bit value. 0 <= duty_cycle <= 255

Transistor as the switching device
- Use an NPN Transistor as a switch
    - This device is designed for use as medium power amplifer and switch requiring collector currents upt to 500 mA
- A transitor allows on/off control to be automated ana it allows switching of more current than and Arduino digital pin can supply
- H-Bridge uses 4 switches and some diodes
    - Pro: one line needed for forward/reverse
    - Con: higher frequencies needed


### AC motors
- Lots of everything there
- Single phase
- Three-phase
- Difficult to mange
- Need to generate a sinusoid

### Stepper motor selection
- Permanent Magent/Variable Reluctance
- Unipolar vs Bipolar
- Number of Stacks
- Number of Phases
- Degress Per Step
- Microstepping
- Pull-In/Pull-Out Torque
- Detent Torque

### Servo motor
- Gears, DC Motor, Position potentiometer, Small microcontroller or Specialized Servo IC

### Brushless DC Motors
- Uses controll board
- Work much longer than regular DC Motor because there is less metal touching bruhes.
- But brushed mtors are cheaper, easy to control, Require less wires, Simple control circuit
- Long lifespan, very high efficiency, Low noise generation, High power to size ration
