# Gyroscope and GPS

### What is a Gyroscope

- Device used o measure or maintain orientation
- Works on the principals of angular momentum
    - Initial axis of rotation is conserved
- Consists of a spinning mass on an axel

- Machanical Gyroscope
    - Spinning mass mounted on gimbals
    - Free output vs Fixed output
    - Sensors on axis to detect rotation
    - Procession
- Electric Gyroscope
    - Coriolis biratory gyroscope
    - Proof mass fed oscillatiing current to include vibrations
    - Vibrating mass tends to oscillate in initial plane of reference
    - When rotatted, oscillations in orthogonal plane deteced by circuit
